# difficulty: easy

# Problem, O(n+k) time and space
# A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

# For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
# You are given a sentence s​​​​​​ and an integer k​​​​​​. You want to truncate s​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first k​​​​​​ words. Return s​​​​​​ after truncating it.

class Solution:
    def truncateSentence(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        return ' '.join(s.split(' ')[:k])
