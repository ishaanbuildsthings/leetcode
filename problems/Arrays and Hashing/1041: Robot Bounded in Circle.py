# https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/description/
# difficulty: medium

# Problem
# On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:

# The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
# The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
# The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
# The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
# The robot can receive one of three instructions:

# "G": go straight 1 unit.
# "L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
# "R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
# The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

# Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

# Solution, O(n) time O(1) space, check 4 cycles
# edit, I think you can do it in O(1*n) by checking the direction offset
