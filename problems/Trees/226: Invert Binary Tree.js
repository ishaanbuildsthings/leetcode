// Problem
/*
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
*/

// Solution, O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we need to invert every node, and n (for space) is the depth of the tree, where worst case n=number of nodes. Create a recursive function that inverts the two children, then calls those two children.
// * Solution 2 has the version without the unnecessary closure, which is a bit harder to read IMO because everything is called root

var invertTree = function (root) {
  function invertChildren(node) {
    if (!node) {
      return;
    }
    const temp = node.left;
    node.left = node.right;
    node.right = temp;
    invertChildren(node.left);
    invertChildren(node.right);
  }
  invertChildren(root);
  return root;
};

// Solution 2, same as solution 1 but skips the unnecessary closure

var invertTree = function (root) {
  // if we called invert on a null then don't do anything
  if (!root) {
    return null;
  }

  // reverse the children and recurse
  const temp = root.left;
  root.left = root.right;
  root.right = temp;
  invertTree(root.left);
  invertTree(root.right);

  return root;
};
