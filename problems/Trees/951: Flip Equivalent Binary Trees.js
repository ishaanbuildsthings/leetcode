DFS through each tree (n + m) time. For each tree, create a mapping of a node's value to a tuple of the children's values. Then compare each key in the mappings to ensure the tuples are the same or reversed. We also need to validate they are the same length, as if we iterate over the shorter one we might erronously have a match.

// Solution 2, the nicer pure recursive solution, still O(n + m) ttime and O(n + m) space, but now the space is the heights rather than all nodes (since previously we stored mappings for all nodes).

/*
To compare two trees, first evaluate the simple cases. If both nodes are null, we have valid trees. If just one is null, we do not. If we have two nodes, but their values are different, it is still invalid.

If we have two nodes that have the same values, then we need to recurse down. We have two possible ways that make it valid. If tree1 left child is flip equivalent to tree2 left child, and tree1 right child is flip equivalent to tree2 right child, then tree1 is flip equivalent to tree2.

But, we could also flip them, so we need to check the flipped orientation as well.
