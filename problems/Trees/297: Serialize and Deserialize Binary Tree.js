// tags: binary tree, preorder

// Problem
/*
Simplified: We are given a binary tree. We need to serialize it, then deserialize it to produce the same tree.

Detailed:
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

// Solution, O(n) for serialization and O(n) for deserialization
/*
To serialize, do a preorder traversal along with nulls, which uniquely serializes. Return the stringified traversal.

To deserialize:

[1, null, null]
recurse(0)

1) take the 0th value and create a node
2) create a left subtree, starting at i+1
3) that left subtree terminates at a certain index, now we create a right subtree, starting past that
4) that right subtree terminates
5) return the node

  const preorderTraversal = preorder(root);
