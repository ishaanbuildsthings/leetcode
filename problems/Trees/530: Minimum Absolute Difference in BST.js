// Problem
/*
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
*/

// Solution 1, O(n) time and O(n) (height) space. Do an inorder traversal, which is monotonically increasing for a BST. Track the differences.

  let minDifference = Infinity;

  let prevValue = Infinity; // starts at infinity so our initial difference between the root and a non-existent previous value, is infinity

// Solution 2, O(n) time and O(n) (height) space. Bottom up recursion. This is a good solution! We recurse down to the bottom, then bubble up results with the smallest and largest values in a tree. We don't need two functions, we just use a tuple.

        a bit hacky, there are other ways to fix this, just by using more `if` statements to check or verify if a child is null, and if it is null, don't process it the same way. regardless, this works because:

        1) if a node is null, we will say its smallest value is infinity, and its largest is -infinity. therefore, when it bubbles up to the parent, the parent will not update its smallest or largest because of  those. aalso, the difference between the node's value and these infinities is infinity, so the reult doesn't get updated.

// Solution 3, O(n) time and O(n) space. Really bad recursion with memoization.
/*
Create a map that maps a node to the smallest value in its tree, and do the same for the largest value. Iterate through all nodes, compare the node's value with the largest value in its left subtree, and the smallest value in its right subtree, updating the result if we need. This solution started from the top, recursing down in a weird way. This code was very inelegant and should not be used as a reference.

var getMinimumDifference = function (root) {
  const smallestCache = new Map(); // maps nodes to the smallest values their subtrees contain
  /*
    this function will recurse throughout the tree, mapping nodes to the smallest values they contain in that tree.
    the idea is to both populate the mapping, and to recursively call the function, all in one function, unlike doing it in two functions (such as 543: Diameter of Binary Tree).

    Say we start at a root node:
       4
      / \
     2   6

    To solve for the smallest value 4 contains, we take the smallest value it's left subtree has, so we recurse on 2.

    At 2, we don't have a left child, so we return 2.

    Now we are back at 4, and we know the smallest value is 2. We recurse on 4's chilren, 2 and 6, because we want to solve for other nodes 2.

    When we get to node 2, we don't want to do repeated work. So we check if that node is already cached, and if so, we recurse on its children, and skip solving for 2.
