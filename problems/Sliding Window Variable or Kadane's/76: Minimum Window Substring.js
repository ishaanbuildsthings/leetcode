// Problem
/*
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
*/

// Solution 1
/*
Similar to solution 2, but with some optimizations. When we add a letter we need, for instance our target is ABC and we reach AEEB, adding a B we need, we have to check all the characters. We don't have a way to know if we have enough A's already, enough C's, etc. We can know if we already had enough B's we could skip that, but that's a different optimization. What we should do is keep a count for how many letter types we still need more of, for instance after AEEB we need only 1 more, which is to fulfill the Cs. We know this because we have 2 fulfilled, and we needed 3 fulfilled overall. Any time we reach a letter, if we fulfill it we update our fulfill count. Anytime if we decrement a letter and we dip below the needed amount for that, we remove 1 from our had count. When our haveCount===needCount, we know we have a valid substring. This is better because instead of iterating through each letter to check if we fulfilled those, we just keep a count of how many we have. And we know if we fulfill a new one for the first time, it wasn't counted before, and must go up.

// Solution 2
// Same as solution 3, but using pointers instead of lots of .slice. Also added a condition to skip characters that aren't in the target at all. They can be ignored, because they would never make the window desirable. It doesn't matter if we decrement those from the windowMapping when we delete them from the left (they would become negative since we never added them) since we never use those values anyway. Also added an optimization that when we decrement from the left, we only check if decrementing that character made our window undesirable, since we were desirable before.

// Solution 3
// *** SEE SOLUTION 1 AND 2 WRITEUPS ***
// O(n+m) time, I think. n is the length of the string, m is the length of the target. Technically we can also say the time complexity is O(n) since if the length of the target is > the length of the string we can immediately return an empty string. As for the n part of the time complexity, I believe it is linear. We iterate over the string n times. The only operation inside the loop I am unsure of is when we do string.slice(...). string.slice(l, r) itself is an r-l computation, but I don't see a way to guarantee that the values of r-l will be linear. It comes down to how often we need to update the minimum substring. A trivial improvement would be to use pointers to track the location of the substring boundaries, and compute the substring only once at the end, which would definitely make the complexity linear. The space storage is O(1) since letter mappings are fixed in size.

// Create a target mapping. Iterate over the string, adding characters. If we already have too many of that character, we know this new character won't make our window valid, so continue. If we see a new character, add it, and check if we are desirable. If not, continue the while loop. If we are desirable, update the minimum substring, and decrement from the left until we aren't desirable, updating each time.
/*
A strange case may be: AEECEEBCA and our target is ABC
Our first desirable window is A...BC. When we decrement from the left, we drop the A, which makes our window undesirable. But we can keep decrementing technically, since removing extra characters like the C, or unrelated characters like the E won't add further issues to our window. But we don't need to do this. This is because the next time our window is desirable, on the last A, we will decrement from the left continuously until it isn't, and we would drop those extra characters then. If the last character of the window specifically makes it desirable, then when we decrement from the left and make it undesirable, we don't care about decrementing more letters like the E or first C, because we would have no more characters to make the window desirable again anyway.
