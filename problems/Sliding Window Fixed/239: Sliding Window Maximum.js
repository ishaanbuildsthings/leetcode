// Difficulty: Hard
// tags: sliding window fixed, monotonic queue, deque

// Problem
/*
Simple explanation: return an array that contains the max for each sliding window of size k

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.
*/

// Solution
// O(n) time and O(n) space. Use a deque to keep track of the maxes. The deque will always be sorted from largest to smallest. When we add a new element, we remove all elements smaller than it from the back of the deque. When we remove an element, we check if the element is the max, and if it is, we remove it from the front of the deque.

  constructor() {
    // when the head is bigger than the tail, they are crossed, and the deque is empty, otherwise the head and tail point to the head and tail elements
    this.headPosition = 0;

    this.storage = {};
