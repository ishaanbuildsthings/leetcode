// Problem
/*
Simplified:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Detailed:

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

// Solution, I think O(n^3 + m*k) For each letter, we check n previous letters, and do a .slice of time n. I do not think the .slices are amortized. Since for each prior dp, if it is true, we have to check the .slice. And maybe only on the last dp do we find a true solution. O(n + m*k) space for the dp, m*k space for the word set.
// * Solution 2. instead, we could maintain the same dp array indicating if the word break is doable up to that point. For each word in the word dict, for each ending letter in the word, check if our word is part of the end of that substring, and the beginning is part of the dp.
// * We can optimize the above with a trie, so insread of re-searching the entire word from the word-dict, we increment in the trie and see if there is a word there (I think this should work)
/*
To solve this, we start at a sub-problem, which is considering just the beginning letter. Say our word is 'abc' and our word dict is 'a', 'bc'.

At 'a', we know it is in the word dict (we use a set). So dp[0] = true, because the problem from the start, to the ending index of 0, is solveable.

Now try 'ab'. Consider all prior prefixes. For instance the empty prefix, dp[-1], is true (by default). So 'ab' is doable if '' (prior dp) + 'ab' new substring we consider is in the word dict. 'ab' is not in the word dict though. But now we try the prefix 'a'. dp[0] is true, so we check if the string from [1, 1] is in the dict. 'b' is not, so 'ab' is not doable.

Repeat the process for all letters, then return the final dp.

For each letter, we look at n prior letters. For each prior letter, if that dp is true, we do a length n substring slice, and break if we get a true statement. We also spend m*k time populating the set, where m is the number of words and k is the length of them, in the word dict.

    stores if the word starting from 0, ending to a certain index in the dp, can be "word break-ed"
    for instance in 'abc' worddict = ['a' 'b']

    at index 1 of the dp, we have 'ab', which can be word break-ed, so we would say true

  const dp = new Array(s.length).fill(false);
  dp[-1] = true; // since for a word, we iterate over all previous words to see if we had a true dp there, we also need to consider the case that the entire word for what we are solving is in the word dict. for instance if we are solving for 'abc' and 'abcdef' and 'abc' is a word, when we get to the 'abc' sub problem, we should look at the previous ending of -1, which essentially means we are using the entire word as the substring

  // iterate over each letter of the word, solving the word break if we were to end at that letter
  for (let endingIndex = 0; endingIndex < s.length; endingIndex++) {
