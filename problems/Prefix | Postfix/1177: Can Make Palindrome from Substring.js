// Problem
/*
You are given a string s and array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti, ki]. We may rearrange the substring s[lefti...righti] for each query and then choose up to ki of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.

If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.

Return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is the result of the ith query queries[i].

Note that each letter is counted individually for replacement, so if, for example s[lefti...righti] = "aaa", and ki = 2, we can only replace two of the letters. Also, note that no query modifies the initial string s.
*/

// Solution, O(s + queries) time, O(s) space
/*
For a given set of letters and k replacements, we need to know if we can make a palindrome. To do so, all even frequency letters are irrelevant. We care about the odd frequency. If we have two odds, we cannot make a palindrome. But if we have two odds and a replacement, we can replace one odd into the other odd, resulting in no odds.

So, set up a range query for the counts of letters. Then, for a range, check up to 26 letters and process the replacements if needed.
