// tags: dynamic programming 2d, palindrome

// Problem
/*
Simplified:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Detailed:
Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

// Solution 1, O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space, dynamic programming
// * Solution 2 below is O(n^2) time and O(1) space using expand around centers

/*
Allocate a dp matrix where the dimensions are starting index x ending index. The result of that cell is if that substring is a palindrome. Then, solve prior dp problems as we do normally.

for instance in aba:

  start at the end, is `a` a palindrome, yes, by default all length 1 things are palindromes, this is our base case

  look at b, iterate through all future letters. we see the next letter, a, since the letters are adjacent, they are only a palindrome if the letters are the same, in this case they are not, so `ba` which is [1][2] is not a palindrome

  look at the first a, iterate through the right, `ab` is not a palindrome. but when we get to `aba`, we look at the [1][1] case, and see it is a palindrome, so aba, or [0][2] is now a palindrome

  * We could also start the beginning, and for each element scan the prior n elements (either left to right or right to left).

For each index of the string, we expand left and right around that center. As long as those letters are the same, we get another palindrome. This only does odd palindrome's though, we need to do even ones too. I made a helper function to use the starting index and ending index (either the same, or separated by 1, for even palindromes), which then expands around centers and returns the number of palindromes there.
