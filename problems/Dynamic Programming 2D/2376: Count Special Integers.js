// Problem
// We call a positive integer special if all of its digits are distinct.

// Given a positive integer n, return the number of special integers that belong to the interval [1, n].

// Solution, complexities listed inside
// Say we have taken some numbers. For that state, we need to know which numbers we took, so we don't repeat numbers. We also need to know the current index we are inserting a number at. This kind of represents an offset. For instance if our number is at most 5 digits, 00_ _ _ is clearly different than 0 _ _ _ _, even if the digit we insert is the same. We also need to know if we are allowed to break the bounds of the ith digit, this is the tight variable. For instance if n=25, and we pick a 1 for the first digit, we have free choice for the next. If we pick a 2, we are still bounded. We also use the index to compute this.

// Establish a dp state of length(n) * 2 (if tight or not) * bitmask (which numbers we have taken). This is 20*1024. Each state considers up to 10 digits.

// For each state, we check which digits we can take. If we are still tight, we can only take up to the ith digit of the original number. We also cannot take duplicate numbers so we check our mask. We can always take a 0 if we are leading, but once we aren't leading anymore, we can only take a 0 once, and we start marking the mask.
// can maybe compress the for loop, didn't read problem but lots of digit DP can be compressed
