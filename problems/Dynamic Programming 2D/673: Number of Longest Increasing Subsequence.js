// Problem
/*
Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.
*/

// Solution, O(n^2) time and O(n) space. O(n log n) time is easily doable but I implemented this first.
/*
This question is very similar to a normal LIS problem, the only difference is, when we find a subsequence of a new longest length, we need to reset our result count. If we find a subsequence of the same length, we add to our result count.

We also need to importantly track how many ways a subsequence of a given length can be reached. For instance in [1, 1, 3], at 3, we have 2 subsequences of length 2, not just 1. So our memo array stores tuples of [length, count].

The n log n is doable with the binary search LIS version, I just don't think it is worth implementing unless needed to not TLE.
