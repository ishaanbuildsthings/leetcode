# difficulty: hard
# tags: dynamic programming 2d

# Problem
# You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

# You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

# You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].

# Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.

# Solution
# Standard DP. Solution 1: states are the index, prev jobs finished, and prev max of whatever current job we are in. This is n^2 * d complexity. I pruned when finished jobs was >d, but it isn't needed. We can even prune when we won't have enough jobs left compared to the amount we need to complete.
# Solution 2: We have n*d states but do an n scan each time. Same time complexity, better space.
