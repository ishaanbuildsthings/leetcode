// Problem
/*
Simplified:

Input: nums = [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
Output: 4
Explanation:  The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].

Detailed:

Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.

Note that:

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).

// Solution, O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space as in the worst case every element could have a different diff from every other element, meaning the hashmaps are of size n

/*
Maintain a dp array of length n, where each element is a hash map. The hash map will map a diff to the length of the longest subsequence that ends at that index with that diff. For instance, if we have [9, 6, 3]. We start iterating from the 2nd to last element, backwards (last element is base case).

* We could also iterate from the beginning, and check prior elements (either left to right, or right to left), but in my opinion doing it the other way around is a bit simpler.

At 6, we start iterating for all future numbers. We see a 3, which makes a diff of -3. So we know the 6 has { -3 : 2 }, as in a sequence of length 2 can be made, starting at 6.

At 9, we look at 6. The diff is -3. 6 already has a subsequence using that diff, of length 2, so we extend the length, meaning at 9 we have { -3 : 3 }.

Be careful not to overwrite things:

say we had ths sequence 2, 5, 8, 5

    at the first 5, we know we can make a sequence of length 2, with a diff of +3
    so when we are solving for the 2, and we see that, we know we can make a sequence of length 3
    but when we get to the second 5, we also know that using a diff of +3 we can make a sequence of length 2 in this case, which is just the default.

    we shouldn't overwrite our +3 diff data, which is why we take the max of if we already had that diff, as well as the new sequence length

   each element of the dp will hold a hash map for a diff to how long that subsequence is
    for instance in 1, 6, 3
    at 6:
    { -3 : 2 }

    at 1:
    { +5 : 2, +2 : 2 }

    so when we look at an earlier element in the dp, we scan across n elements to the right of it. for each element, we lookup the diff to determine how long we can make the current subsequence
