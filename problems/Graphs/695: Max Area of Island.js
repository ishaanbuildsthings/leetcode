// Problem
/*
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
*/

// Solution, O(n*m) time and O(n*m) space
// * Solution 2, I think O(min(n,m) space could be done if we mutated the input to mark things as visited, and used bfs / a queue)
/*
Maintain a visited matrix of cells. Iterate through all root cells, doing a dfs for the whole island, tracking the size. Update the result as needed. There are a few ways to handle the base cases.

1) When we reach a cell out of bounds, or water, we return 0. Otherwise, we return 1 (for the current cell) plus the sum of the dfs calls for the adjacent cells.
2) We never recurse to invalid cells. We return 1 + the size of the adjacent cells.

I did option 2.
