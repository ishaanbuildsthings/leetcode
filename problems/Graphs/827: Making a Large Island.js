// Problem
/*
You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.
*/

// Solution, O(n*m) time and O(n*m) space
/*
First, find the size of all islands, and give a unique idx to each island. So each cell in the islandInfo matrix will contain the size of the island it is in along with its idx.

Then, iterate through each water cell, seeing if we made it land, the total size of the island we would form, by checking the idx / sizes of adjacent islands.

I think for a follow up question where we can flip k ocean tiles, we could maybe use a state machine solution in conjunction with this solution.

In this problem, I also tried writing code so that we return 0 when we reach a border or water, as opposed to never iterating to those neighbors. Just for practice.

    each cell stores information for a given tile of land (water tiles have null)
    when we visit / dfs through an island, and we determine the size of it, we will update all of those cells in here to say the size. we also give each cell an island idx, so each cell has [size, idx]. Later, when we iterate through every cell, testing a flip, we look at the neighbors, determine how many unique islands we connect, and determine the new size
