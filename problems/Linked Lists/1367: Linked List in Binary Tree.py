# Problem
# Given a binary tree root and a linked list with head as the first node.

# Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.

# In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.


# Solution
# I did some recursive solution, and write rolling hash can get us linear.
# Looking back, I recursed on each node, and if we fully exhausted something we have a basecase. If we haven't yet started the matching process we recurse to a child, otherwise we start the process now.
# A rolling hash could involve serializing the linked list, descending down the tree maintaing a hash for our current descent, and matching it. Actually I have to think more about this since the hash for the tree doesn't start at the root.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

# can use rolling hash which can get us linear
