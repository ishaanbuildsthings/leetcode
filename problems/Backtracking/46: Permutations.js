// Solution 1, adding number of neighbor and popping it
// time: O(n * n!), there are n! possible permutations and each one takes n time to serialize. Each one also takes n time to iterate possible continuations. Our space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive callstack. Complexities are listed assuming a set is used.
/*
Maintain a backtracking list. Call all numbers, filtering ones we already have. Do this by adding the number to the stack, calling it, then popping.

Both solution 1 and solution 2 can be improved by using a set for lookup speed.
