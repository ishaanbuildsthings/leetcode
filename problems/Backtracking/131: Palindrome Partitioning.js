// Problem
/*
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.
*/

// Solution
// Depth of tree = # of letters in the string. We can either use that letter to end a palindrome, or keep incrementing, meaning 2 branches. Every time we get a solution, we take n time to serialize it. So time = n * 2^n. Space is O(n) due to the height of the callstack or the size of the array.
/*
Use backtracking. For each letter, we can either end there if it is a palindrome, or keep going. Backtrack on if we do use it as a palindrome, and if we don't. We maintain a total count for the number of letters we have used, so at the end if we skip the last letter we don't count it as a solution.

Another way to implement this without the total letter count is to determine all possible palindromes starting at an index, then backtrack across all of them.
