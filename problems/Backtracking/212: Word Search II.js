// Problem
/*
Simplified:
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]

Detailed:
Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
*/

// Solution, no complexities yet, but generally the efficient solution
/*
Create a trie with all the words in `words`. Then, run a root backtrack across all cells in the grid. We can recurse to a neighbor if we haven't yet visited that cell. Once we recurse, check if we have a valid prefix, if so, keep going. Add things to the result as we find words.

Some notes and optimizations:
1) Using an array to track the letters we are at is not good, because we don't delay our join until the end. Rather, we join every iteration, so direct string addition is better.

2) It is better to enter the bad node and terminate, than to peek ahead to see if it is valid, and if it is, call that node. Since if it is valid we end up doing string addition twice.

3) We can backtrack within the trie nodes as well to prevent O(n) searchPrefix lookups. We can do this by making our DFS function take in the trienode as well, and then instead of O(n) lookups in the trie, we just check if the current cell exists as a child of the node we received.

4) We can also prune from the tree as we find words, so we stop iterating out as not needed.

5) I think one efficiency might be that instead of adding strings each time we accrue a letter, we have our trienodes contain the word they end on. So if `oath` is a word, the h should say .word = 'oath'. Now as we traverse, we know we are valid if our node is a child. And if we reach a node that is a word, we can add that word to our result.
