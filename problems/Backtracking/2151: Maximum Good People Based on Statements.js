/*
There are two types of persons:

The good person: The person who always tells the truth.
The bad person: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array statements of size n x n that represents the statements made by n people about each other. More specifically, statements[i][j] could be one of the following:

0 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a bad person.
1 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a good person.
2 represents that no statement is made by person i about person j.
Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that statements[i][i] = 2 for all 0 <= i < n.

Return the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.

// Solution, O(n^2 * 2^n) time, O(n) space for the recursive callstack, each callstack stores a mask too, which we can technically consider n space, since we are using the bits, so maybe n^2 space. also n^2*2^n can be optimized to n*2^n if we don't use bitmask

This was my first double beats 100%!

I am dumb and did not realize we don't need to memoize anything, since there is nothing we can memoize. Each state is unique. So I wrote it as a dp at first but realized we can't memoize anything, so it's basically backtracking. As a consequence, my solution became way more convoluted than it needs to be. Instead of using a bitmask, I could have just used an array of people to track who is currently deemed bad or good. Because I used a bitmask, I also do n bit shifts in an inner loop, hence bigger time complexity. Though in practice it is probably faster still.

Essentially just brute force backtrack. If we say a person is good, validate all statements they have made about prior people, and all prior good people's statements about this person. If we say a person is bad, validate all prior good people's statements about this person. We don't have to worry about a case where person 0 says a future person is bad, and person 1 says they are good, because when we get to that future person, we valid the prior people's statements.
