Legacy notes: https://github.com/ishaanbuildsthings/leetcode/blob/main/notes/guides/Two%20Pointers.txt

## Tricky techniques:

There's a tricky two pointer greedy technique where we have to "pair things up". 2410 and 881 (boats to save people) showcase this well.

## Good problems:

**283 Move Zeroes** - https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/
**2410 Maximum Matching of Players with Trainers** - https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/
**881 Boats to Save People** - https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/
