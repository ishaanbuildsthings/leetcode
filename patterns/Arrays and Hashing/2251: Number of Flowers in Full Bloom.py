# Problem
# You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.

# Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the ith person arrives.

# Solution, O(n log n) time, O(n) space
# The range where flowers can exist is too wide to create a true sweep line. Instead, we just make a sweep line representing the critical moments where the number of flowers change. Then, we can create a prefix sweep to tell us the number of flowers in some range. Then we binary search on that prefix sweep to answer a query.
# EDIT NODE: Later (after learning lazy segment trees), I realize this was coordinate compression. I came up with it before realizing it existed!
# I think this can be done with a single sweep line. Just iterate over the ranges, and construct the prefix sweep in one go.
# SOLUTION 2: We can also use a segment tree for the coordinates flowers appear. We add to segments with lazy propagation, and query individual indices. We use coordinate compression since the range flowers can be in is wide. (Scroll down to see the code, below the first solution)
# Note 8/22/2024 - There's a lot of solutions I think. For instance process the earliest people first and use a pointer on the flowers with a heap for endings of previous flower segments. I think my original solution can remove a sort too.
